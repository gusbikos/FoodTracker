    lsof -i :8000,
    kill -9 (port number)



Notes and project workflow:
Day 1 Frontend:
    - Created react project inside frontend directory
Day 1 Backend:
    - Created folder structure for backend
    - Added __init__.py files where needed (__init__.py tells Python that a folder is a package and controls what gets imported from it.)
    - Created virtual enviornment and downloaded packages needed -- added all dependencies to requirements.txt
    - Created Auth headers
        - Staging require an http basic auth to avoid search engine indexing. The username is off, and the password off. (This sentence is from OpenFoodsAPI docs)
        - username = "off", password = "off"
        - Utilized requests.auth "HTTPBasicAuth" module 
            - basic_auth = HTTPBasicAuth(username, password)
    - Initialized main.py and foods.py
        - main.py starts FastAPI and defines API routes.
        - foods.py handles food data logic and calls OpenFoodFacts.
        - main.py passes barcode values to foods.py functions.
        - foods.py fetches and processes the product data.
        - main.py returns the data to the client as JSON.
        - Separation keeps routing and business logic organized.
